# go_weatherapi

## Intro:

In this project we are going to write a simple api that will call the weather api:

```
https://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather?lat=63.5888&lon=154.4931&appid=apiId
```

and return the following data:

*This endpoint should return what the weather condition is outside in that area (snow, rain,
etc), whether itâ€™s hot, cold, or moderate outside (use your own discretion on what temperature equates to
each type).*

### This is an example json response
```
{
    "feels_like": "It's Cold",
    "conditon": "clear sky",
    "temp": 55.02,
    "place_name": "US",
    "country": "Miami"
}
```

This api will take 3 inputs:

```
lat
lon
appid
```

Where the `appid` is the **`SECRET_KEY`** variable in the .env file

### Other important variables that you can setup in your .env are:

`PORT` 

.env file example
```
SECRET_KEY=yoursecretkeyprovidedbyopenweathermap
PORT=8080
```

Once you place *your* unique apikey, you can build and run the project

### To build and execute the project run the following comands:
```
make build
make run
```
alternatively you could also just run:
```
make all
```

### Then to get the information I created a GET http route:

```
http://localhost:{PORT}/api/get-weather?lat={lat}&lon={lon}
```
### You can test it with the command
```
make get_miami_info
```
This will show the information in the example response in the console 

and that should return you the information of the weather conditions & temperature
