# go_weatherapi

## Intro:

In this project we are going to write a simple api that will call the weather api:

```go
https://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather?lat=63.5888&lon=154.4931&appid=apiId
```

and return the following data:

*This endpoint should return what the weather condition is outside in that area (snow, rain,
etc), whether itâ€™s hot, cold, or moderate outside (use your own discretion on what temperature equates to
each type).*

This api will take 3 inputs:

```go
lat
lon
appid
```

Where the `appid` is the SECRET_KEY variable in the .env file

once you place *your* unique apikey, the project should run as normal 

Then to get the information I created a GET http route:

```go
/api/getweather?lat={lat}&lon={lon}
```

and that should return you the information of the weather conditions & temperature

### Other important variables that you can setup in your .env are:

`PORT` 

`BINARY`

Although the binary can be also added in the Makefile, you can add your BINARY executable name in the .env too.

### To build and execute the project run the following comands:
```
make build
make run
```
alternatively you could also just run:
```
make all
```
